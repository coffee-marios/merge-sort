## merge-sort

Using the merge sort methodology (based on recursion) we take an unsorted array and return it sorted - it is the same array but modified!

#

## fib

We have two functions that solve the same problem, but in a different way; they take a number and return an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.

The first function uses iteration and the other recursion.

Because there is no GUI component to this project, you need to use the command line run these files.
